#Q6 â€“ Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is
#one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day.
#The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing what the salary was for each day,
#and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount,
#not the number of pennies.
