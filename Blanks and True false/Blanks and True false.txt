Blanks:

1.	A controlled loop uses a true/false condition to control the number of times that it repeats: condition
2.	Which of the following is a count-controlled loop? For Loop
3.	Each repetition of a loop is known as a(n): iteration
4.	The while loop is a	type of loop: pretest
5.	A(n) _	loop has no way of ending and repeats until the program is inter- Rupted: infinite
6.	The -= operator is an example of a(n)	operator: augmented assignment
7.	A(n) _	variable keeps a running total: Accumulator
8.	A variable used to calculate the number of iterations of a loop is called a(n): counter
9.	A variable that is used to mark the end of a sequence of values is known as a(n): sentinel
10.	A(n)	loop is sometimes called an error handler: input validation
11.	The input operation that appears just before a validation loop is known as the: priming read
12.	_____ is a keyword that is used to get out from the iteration of a loop immediately: Break

True False:

1.	A condition-controlled loop always repeats a specific number of times. True
2.	The while loop is a pretest loop. True
3.	In a while loop, the key word continue is used to stop the execution of the loop. False
4.	It is not necessary to initialize accumulator variables. False
5.	An iterable is an object that is similar to a list and is created by the range function. True
6.	To calculate the total number of iterations of a nested loop, add the number of iterations of all the loops. False
